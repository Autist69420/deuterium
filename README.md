A silly attempt at a lua bytecode decompiler

This project was heavily inspired by [CPunch/LuaDecompy](https://github.com/CPunch/LuaDecompy), so I decided to write it in Rust to learn more about the language.
I know a ton of rust already but definitely not enough to make any competent things. Thus this is a research project.

## Setting up
Someone remind me to write this section lmao
